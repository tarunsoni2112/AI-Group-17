# Segment Analytics.js Integration

This repository provides a streamlined method to integrate Segment's Analytics.js library into your web application, enabling efficient collection and routing of customer data to various analytics tools.

## Features

- **Unified Data Collection:** Capture customer interactions through a single API and send them to multiple analytics services.
- **Custom Integrations:** Develop and include custom analytics integrations tailored to your application's needs.
- **Middleware Support:** Extend Analytics.js with custom code that runs on every event, allowing for payload enrichment and transformation.

## Getting Started

To integrate Analytics.js into your project:

1. **Install the Package:**

   ```bash
   npm install @segment/analytics-next
   ```


2. **Initialize Analytics.js:**

   ```javascript
   import { AnalyticsBrowser } from '@segment/analytics-next';

   const analytics = AnalyticsBrowser.load({ writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>' });

   analytics.page();
   ```


   Replace `<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>` with your Segment write key.

3. **Track Events:**

   ```javascript
   analytics.track('Event Name', {
     property1: 'value1',
     property2: 'value2'
   });
   ```


   This will send the event data to your connected analytics services.

## Custom Integrations

To create a custom integration:

1. **Define the Integration:**

   ```javascript
   import integration from '@segment/analytics.js-integration';

   const CustomIntegration = integration('Custom Integration')
     .global('custom')
     .option('apiKey', '')
     .tag('<script src="https://example.com/custom-integration.js"></script>');
   ```


2. **Implement Methods:**

   ```javascript
   CustomIntegration.prototype.initialize = function() {
     window.custom.init(this.options.apiKey);
     this.load(this.ready);
   };

   CustomIntegration.prototype.track = function(event, properties) {
     window.custom.track(event, properties);
   };
   ```


3. **Add Integration to Analytics.js:**

   ```javascript
   analytics.use(CustomIntegration);
   analytics.initialize({
     'Custom Integration': {
       apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
     }
   });
   ```


   Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your integration's API key.

## Middleware

Analytics.js supports middleware functions that allow you to modify event payloads before they are sent to destinations. This enables custom processing such as data enrichment or filtering.

**Adding Source Middleware:**


```javascript
analytics.addSourceMiddleware(function(payload, next) {
  // Modify the payload
  payload.obj.context.custom = 'value';
  next(payload);
});
```


**Adding Destination Middleware:**


```javascript
analytics.addDestinationMiddleware('Integration Name', function(payload, next) {
  // Modify the payload for the specific integration
  payload.obj.properties.custom = 'value';
  next(payload);
});
```

